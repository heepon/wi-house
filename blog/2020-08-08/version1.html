                We went to get groceries at Hmart today. We came home thinking about Bulgogi and Kkannip from the garden.
                <br>

                This time I blended onion instead of using mirin and sugar to sweeten the yangnyum(marinating sauce).
                And it came out really sweet and kind. It felt like round. Also, it added nice thick consistency to the sauce.
                Hehe. Another big hit was Eojingeo Cho Muchim(오징어 초무침) with cucumber. "Eojingeo" means squid, "Cho" means vinegar, and "Muchim" means 
                cold marinated salad type side dish of Korea. I sliced cucmber about a quater inch thick then pour Asazuke liquid and kept in the
                refridgerator for cold and crunch texture while it's pickled. Then I cleaned the fresh squid, removed the skin, and cut into strips.
                I blanced the squid quickly and rinsed it with cold water. I recommend doing the quick blanching no longer than 4 min to keep the 
                tender texture of fresh squid.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now it's time to combine squid and cucumber together and marinate!<br>
                Put squid and cucumber in a bowl. Add corse Gochugaru, vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds, lil sugar to the bowl.
                Use your hand. Mix them rigorously. Ahhh... my tongue hurts while I'm writing this recipe. I want it again!<br>
                Enjoy. So lovely cold summer side dish that you will love with rice or somen. <br>

            We loved our dinner. Especially making Ssam bites with bulgogi and freshly picked Kkannip (perilla leaves, 깻잎) from our garden
            hit the spot. Omg. I will share my Gochujang Bulgogi recipe soon. <br>
